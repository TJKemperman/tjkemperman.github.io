                    <p>One of the main reasons that I chose my next education to be the HBO-ICT education at HZ, was to
                        see how more advanced the learning would be, and how much it would demand of me as a student. At
                        Scalda, I did not really feel a lot of pressure, and I did not see myself in a working life just
                        yet. As such, I went to go to HZ as a good challenge for myself. To see myself working at a
                        solid pace.</p>
                    <p>Aside from the increase in pace, I am very willing to learn more. Compared to Software
                        Development, HBO-ICT offers a lot more to learn, especially content like Data Science and
                        Computer Science Basics. I have never really had much of that, so that is something new that I
                        am very willing to pick up.</p>
                    <p>A more general reason as to why I picked the ICT field, has to mostly do with my hobby of playing
                        games.
                        I personally wanted to know how games were developed, which lead me to originally wanting to go
                        to
                        the Breda University of Applied Sciences to do Game Development there. I decided against it when
                        the
                        assignment given to apply was quite large and I did not understand any of it. However, it had
                        piqued my interest
                        enough to want to backtrack a bit, and go into Software Development in general, to see how sites
                        and such are built.
                        This lead me to pick the Software Development education at Scalda in Vlissingen, which I
                        finished, and lead me to the HZ.

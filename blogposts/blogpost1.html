                        <h3>Study Choice Activities</h3>
                        <p>I took part in a few activities before deciding where to take my next step as an IT student.
                            During my final year at Scalda, I went to a few 'Open Days'
                            at a few schools. I went to the Associate Degree Academy in Roosendaal and participated in
                            the Open Day there. Following that, I went to the HZ Middelburg Open Day
                            to check out the HBO-ICT education there. After that, I decided to go check out the Open Day
                            at the Breda University of Applied Sciences to check out
                            the Game Development education.</p>
                        <p>Following the Open Days, the school itself hosted a day at the Associate Degree Academy,
                            inviting students to get a more in-depth look at the ICT education it offered.
                            It mimicked the Open Day pretty much up to a certain point, then we did a small group
                            assignment to have us dip our toes in what the education was.
                        </p>
                        <p>These were the activities I took part in to decide what college I wanted to follow. I
                            eliminated the Game Development one relatively quickly,
                            deciding that I didn't really want to go down that niche, having desires to see what a
                            higher education level would offer me. I ended up picking HZ,
                            because the shorter 2-year education of the AD didn't really fit me. I know that Project
                            Work is inevitable in IT, but the AD would set us into that
                            almost immediately, and I personally prefer the introductory 'lesson part' of education, to
                            get a slightly breezier first part of the education.

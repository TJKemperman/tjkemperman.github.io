                        <h3>Previous Education</h3>
                        <p>I have had previous experience in IT, as my previous education was the Software Development
                            education at Scalda. This was at MBO level, and was 4 years long.
                            In this education, I learned all things related to coding at a fairly basic level, as well
                            as group projects working on assignments given by the school, for the school.
                            I also participated in a few internships, each expanding the amount of coding languages I
                            have picked up and growing my skills as a Software Developer.
                        </p>
                        <h4>First Year</h4>
                        <p>In the first year, it was mostly 45-minute lectures about certain subjects, followed by 1
                            hour sessions where we would work on given assignments, originally from a book.
                            The subjects gave us the basic knowledge on: Programming with Java, Front-End Development
                            using HTML & CSS and learning how to work with a Database. Aside from the technical work,
                            we also got info on how to keep track of our progress as a student as well as setting up a
                            nice environment for our future code and our developments, so that when the internships come
                            around, we have some work to be able to show them.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Second Year</h4>
                        <p>The second year was entirely a group project year. You got selected into a group with fellow
                            students, assigned one of four projects and you spent the following year working on it.
                            Using tools such as Jira to keep track of all the features to be added and updated, and
                            coming together for meetings working in a Scrum environment. Usually your work woukd be done
                            with Java and HTML/CSS, but if you were advanced enough, your group could pick their own
                            language, as long as you were able to back up what you were showing.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Third Year</h4>
                        <p>In the third year, we were selected for an internship. Assistance from a teacher was helpful
                            in finding an internship, and once you were selected, you essentially just got an assignment
                            from the company, which was shown to the school beforehand to make sure it fit with our
                            education, and then we were to work on it, keeping track of our progress and making sure to
                            documentas much as possible, so that by the end, we had a proper way of showing what we had
                            made,how we made it, how we came across problems and solved them. My personal third year
                            internship was at Profects in Kapelle-Biezelinge, where I picked up the basics of Golang.
                            When the internship was finished halfway through the year, we got selected to be part of
                            another group project, usually a different one compared to the first one in the second year.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Fourth Year</h4>
                        <p>In the fourth and final year, it was the reverse of the third year. We'd work on a project
                            for the first half, followed by your graduation internship as the latter half of the year.
                            The group project was pre-selected this time, as all fourth years would combine into a group
                            to work on Pasimo: an attendance-type system, keeping track of students, sorting them into
                            their correct years and groups, and so on. A fairly recent addition when I was working on
                            it, was a system where the students could scan their schoolpass and it would automatically
                            make sure to set their attendance correctly. My graduation internship was at Epesi in Middelburg.</p>
